### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## About Me :pilot:
My name is Cristian Vargas, and I was born and raised in Chicago. I still currently reside in Chicago, but maybe one day will live somewhere else than Illinois. Aside from building applications that can make our lives easier, I love to eat great food, spend time with my family, and travel with my fiancee. Three of my favorite places I have travelled to stateside are Lake Havasu City AZ, Boulder CO, and San Diego CA.
