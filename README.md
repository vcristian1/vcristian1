## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me :rocket:
I was born and raised in Chicago, IL and still reside in Chicago currently. One day I hope to live somewhere else other than Illinois, but aside from building applications that can make our lives easier, I love to eat great food, spend time with my family, and travel with my fiancee!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently open to an entry level position as a Software Engineer. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in a Full Stack Bootcamp at Northwestern University.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Web Development

- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a massive combat sports fan, and likely can talk your ear off about the latest fights in boxing or mma.
